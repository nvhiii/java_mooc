// p1: Creating classes
// Create the following three classes:

// Class A. Class should have no object variables nor should you specify a constructor for it. It only has the method public void a(), which prints a string "A".
// Class B. Class should have no object variables nor should you specify a constructor for it. It only has the method public void b(), which prints a string "B".
// Class C. Class should have no object variables nor should you specify a constructor for it. It only has the method public void c(), which prints a string "C".

// p2: Class inheritance
// Modify the classes so that class B inherits class A, and class C inherits class B. In other words, class A will be a superclass for class B, and class B will be a superclass for class C.



public class A {

    public void a() {
        System.out.println("A");
    }
    
}
