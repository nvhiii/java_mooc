// In the Payment card exercise we used a double-type object variable to 
// store the amount of money. In real applications this is not the approach 
// you want to take, since as we have seen, calculating with doubles is not 
// exact. A more reasonable way to handle amounts of money is create an 
// own class for that purpose. Here is a layout for the class:

// The word final used in the definition of object variables catches 
// attention. The result of this word is that the values of these object 
// variables cannot be modified after they have been set in the 
// constructor. The objects of Money class are unchangeable so immutable 
// â€” if we want to e.g. increase the amount of money, we must create a 
// new object to represent that new amount of money.

// Next we'll create a few operations for processing money.

// Plus
// First create the method public Money plus(Money addition) that returns 
// a new money object that is worth the total amount of the object whose 
// method was called and the object that is received as the parameter.

// The basis for the method is the following:

// Less
// Create the method public boolean lessThan(Money compared) that returns 
// true if the money-object on which the method is called on has a lesser 
// value than the money object given as a parameter.

// Minus
// Write the method 
// public Money minus(Money decreaser) that returns a new money object 
// worth the difference of the object whose method was called and the 
// object received as the parameter. If the difference would be negative, 
// the worth of the created money object is set to 0.

// Here are examples of how the method works.
